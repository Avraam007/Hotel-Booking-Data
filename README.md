📊 Hotel Booking Insights & Summer Overbooking Strategy

This project focuses on turning booking and cancellation data into clear, actionable insights for a hotel group.
Using Excel dashboards, the analysis highlights patterns in summer cancellations, revenue impact, and opportunities to boost profitability through strategic overbooking.

🔍 Key Insights
1. High Summer Cancellations Impact Revenue

July and August show the highest cancellation rates.
These cancellations led to ~$1M in lost revenue one summer.
Higher prices in these months amplify the financial impact.

2. Short-Term Bookings Offer a Revenue Opportunity

Bookings made within 30 days of arrival represent only a small share of cancellations.
They show lower cancellation rates and higher average prices compared to bookings made far in advance.

💡 Business Recommendation

Overbooking same-month reservations during the summer can increase revenue by:
Replacing high-risk advance bookings with more reliable short-notice ones
Reducing revenue loss from cancellations
Selling more rooms at higher average daily rates
